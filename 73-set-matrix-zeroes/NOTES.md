### brute appraoch is to keep another matrix of size n*m and then marking all zeroes in it and then update the original matrix later.
​
### using sets: keep an row set and column set to mark that the particular row is to update or not and same with the column set as well.
​
### optimised approach: using the same matrix keep the first element as zero of that row and column if we are at a i,j=0
### for the first row & first col the first ele is same so keep an other variable for the first column
